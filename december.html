                <p style="color:black"><i>&emsp;As we wrap up a busy and exciting year, I want to take a moment to acknowledge
                    how challenging this time can be: balancing exams, projects, and the rush to finish everything before
                    the holidays is no easy task! This makes it even more important to take a step back, reflect on what
                    we’ve achieved, and look forward to some well-deserved rest.<br/>
                    &emsp;To all of you, especially our international members traveling home after a long time, I wish you a
                    wonderful holiday season. May this special time bring joy, warmth, and cherished moments with your
                    loved ones!<br/>
                    &emsp;As we head into January and February, I’d also like to wish you the very best of luck with your upcoming
                    exams. Remember to take care of yourselves during this busy period, and we’ll be here to support each
                    other as we step into an exciting new year for our association.<br/>
                    &emsp;Before diving into this month’s updates, a quick note: unfortunately, last month’s issue could not
                    reach everyone due to some technical issues that should have now been solved. If you missed it, you
                    can find it <a href="file:///Users/Sofia/Desktop/NextGen%20BioTech/association-newsletter-main/index.html">here</a><br/>

                            related exam? Do you want to level up your current skills or are you an enthusiast in those subjects and AI?
                            Then, you found the right place! This month, I would like to recommend an Instagram page that I recently found:
                            <a href ="https://www.instagram.com/getintoai/">@getintoai</a>.<br/>
                            &emsp;<br/>
                            &emsp;The page delivers short-form contents of advanced mathematical topics in a fashion that makes it really easy to understand.
                            So far, it has covered topics like Linear Regression, Neural Networks, Machine learning, Deep learning and AI.
                            By their names alone, they might sound very advanced and complex, but this page does a great job in breaking them
                            down and explaining the core concepts in a simple manner… and in just under ONE MINUTE!!!<br/>
                            These characteristics make it a great tool if you are interested in expanding your knowledge in a fun way and without having to spend
                            too much of your freetime.<br/>
                            &emsp;<br/>
                            &emsp;The concepts you are going to learn could also come very handy when you are trying to pass an exam, or just to get a clearer
                            vision of what you are learning.<br/>
                            &emsp;<br/>
                           &emsp;@getintoai showed up on my feed right on time for that! A week earlier, I was learning about linear regressions in my statistics
                            class and, while I did understand the concepts explained by the professor, I couldn’t really visualize what I was
                            learning. Being a visual learner, that did not allow me to really grasp the complexity of the topic as well as I
                            would have wanted. Thanks to this video, I was able to fully understand the concept, connect the dots, and really
                            understand even the hardest facets!<br/>
                            &emsp;<br/>
                            &emsp;The instagram page is also a great way to dig into the world of AI, Machine Learning and BigData, so I encourage you to check it out
                            if those are topics that you're passionate about!

                <p><b>&emsp;Gene regulators enabling hearing regeneration identified!</b></p>
                <p>&emsp;A new USC Stem Cell study conducted at Keck School of Medicine of USC has identified key gene regulators
                    that enable some deafened animals, including fish and lizards, to naturally regenerate their hearing.
                    The findings could guide future efforts to stimulate the regeneration of sensory hearing cells in patients
                    with hearing loss and balance disorders. Led by first author Tuo Shi and co-corresponding authors Ksenia
                    Gnedeva and Gage Crump, the study focuses on two cell types in the inner ear: the sensory cells that detect sound,
                    and the supporting cells that create an environment where sensory cells can thrive. In highly regenerative species
                    such as fish and lizards, supporting cells can also transform into replacement sensory cells after injury -
                    a capacity absent in all other mammals.</p>
