		<p style="color:black"><i>&emsp;Dear Members,<br/> 🌸 <b>Welcome to March!</b>🌸</i></p>
                  
                <p style="color:black"><i>&emsp;As always, you'll find updates on what's been happening in our association, a preview of upcoming events, and a special recommendation section, where a founding team member will share some personal tips.<br/>
			&emsp;Curious about the groundbreaking research happening in our department? Good news for you: starting from this issue, we are incorporating a new section of the newsletter, <b>“Research Spotlight - Discover the Frontiers of Biotech”</b>! Each month, we’ll shine a light on a different research area, giving you the chance to dive into innovative projects, explore new topics, and perhaps even uncover an interest you didn’t know you had. Stay informed about the latest scientific advancements at our university and check out the diverse range of labs contributing to these discoveries!</i></p>
 		<p style="color:black"><i>&emsp;Although most of us will probably stay in our little bubble, stressed out over the exams that will keep going for the whole month, February is indeed a month of vibrant celebrations around the world: from the <b>Lunar New Year</b>, bringing joy and renewal to millions, to <b>Carnival</b>, with its colorful parades and rich traditions; not to forget <b>Valentine’s Day</b>, a worldwide celebration of affection and romance.</i></p>
		<p style="color:black"><i>&emsp;The 14th of February also marks another important occasion, much less talked about yet deeply significant: it is <b>Congenital Heart Diseases (CHD) Awareness Day</b>. I personally hold this topic very close to my heart (pun intended!) and I’d like to use this space to spend a couple of words about it.<br/>
			&emsp;CHDs are anatomical anomalies of the heart present from birth and are due to an incomplete or incorrect cardiac development during the first weeks of embryonic life; they may involve the wall of the heart, its valves, the blood vessels, or the position of the arteries and veins. Estimated to <b>affect nearly 1% of newborns</b>, they represent the most common type of birth defect and, unfortunately, the <b>first cause of child mortality</b>. CHDs vary greatly in type and entity and consequently impact people's lives differently: while some lead a “normal” life, approximately one in four of the affected children has a critical heart disease that will require a first emergency surgery within the first month of life and many more throughout it.<br/>
			&emsp;Until a few decades ago, congenital heart defects were fatal within the first years of childhood. Today, thanks to improvements in diagnosis, cutting-edge surgical interventions, and continuous medical research, even patients with very complex clinical pictures have a better prognosis and quality of life.<br/>
			&emsp;Despite these achievements, CHDs remain a major public health concern: there is <b>still no definitive cure</b> for many forms of congenital heart disease, and <b>lifelong medical care</b> is often necessary; furthermore, CHDs are not always clinically evident, making it difficult for affected individuals to get the support they need. Therefore, <b>promoting awareness and supporting research and medical innovation is crucial to ensure better outcomes, better treatments, and a deeper understanding of the battles that CHDs warriors go through everyday.</b><br/>
			&emsp;Multiple research institutions all over Italy, including our University, are contributing to the advancement of CHD treatments: from biomedical engineering to cutting-edge genetic studies, researchers are actively working on improving both diagnostic tools and therapeutic approaches. Ongoing projects are exploring new factors that might be responsible for the development of CHDs, <b>new surgical techniques, the use of biotechnologies for regenerative medicine, the potential role of genetics in the early detection of CHDs, and so much more.</b><br/>

		    <p style="color:black"><i>&emsp;Each month, one of our eight founding members will share a personal recommendation to offer you practical tips for exploring sciences or making the most of life in Bologna. This month, it’s Sofia’s turn… yes, still me, your friendly newsletter writer! XD<br/>
			    &emsp;I'm here to share insights on a piece of literature that, while admittedly intimidating at first (its sheer size—over 650 pages!—might make you hesitate), quickly proves itself to be an absolute masterpiece, weaving together science, history, and storytelling in a way that makes every page worth reading.</i></p>
		    <center><p><b>&emsp;Non-fiction Book Recommendation - from Sofia:<br/>
			    ‘She has her mother’s laugh - the powers, perversions, and potential of heredity’, by Carl Zimmer</b></p></center>

		    <p style="color:black">&emsp;Why do children look like their parents? Mendelian genetics offers a clear answer. But what about the ways they don’t? Why can siblings be so different from one another? And does heredity stop at DNA, or is there more to the story? If you’ve ever found yourself wondering about these questions, <i>She Has Her Mother’s Laugh</i> by Carl Zimmer is the perfect book for you.</p>
		    <p style="color:black">&emsp;Zimmer takes the familiar concept of <b>inheritance</b> and stretches it far <b>beyond the boundaries of DNA</b>, exploring how our understanding of heredity has evolved from ancient misconceptions to cutting-edge genomic research. Rather than treating genetics as a simple set of rules, he reveals a much richer, more complex picture: one where mutations, epigenetics, and even the microbes we carry play a role in shaping who we are. <b>His storytelling blends history, science, and thought-provoking ethical questions, making for an engaging and deeply insightful read.</b></p>
		    <p style="color:black">&emsp;As a genomics student, I was particularly fascinated by his discussion of genetic ‘chimeras’: the idea is that an individual isn’t necessarily made up of identical cells with the same DNA. Mutations and variations can arise during development, meaning that different parts of our body might have slightly different genetic codes. This concept challenges the traditional view of a singular, fixed genome and highlights just how dynamic biology truly is. Zimmer’s ability to <b>unpack such complex ideas in an accessible and compelling way</b> is what makes this book a must-read.</p>
		    <p style="color:black">&emsp;For students and science enthusiasts alike, <i>She Has Her Mother’s Laugh</i> is a reminder that genetics is far more than just Punnett squares and inheritance charts. It’s a <b>story that intersects with medicine, history, and ethics</b>; one that <b>shapes not just our biology, but our identities and societies</b>. Whether you’re passionate about DNA, curious about the future of genetic research, or simply enjoy a well-told science story, this book is an enriching and thought-provoking read.</p>

                <p style="color:black">&emsp;Recent years have seen significant progress in cancer treatments, including ongoing initiatives to develop a cancer vaccine. As noted in this  <a href="https://news.cancerresearchuk.org/2024/12/30/cancer-vaccines-golden-age-of-cancer-research/">article</a>, cancer vaccines “aren’t new: Cancer Research UK-funded science led to the development of the HPV vaccine, which has helped reduce cervical cancer cases by nearly 90% in women in their twenties who received the vaccine at age 12–13.” But, with very recent substantial investments in AI infrastructures that could boost the process, we should definitely keep an eye on the news about cancer vaccines.
